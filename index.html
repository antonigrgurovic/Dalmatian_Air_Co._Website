<h2 id="who">Who We Are</h2>

<p>Established in 1999, Dalmatian Air Co. proudly serves the greater tri-state area specializing in both commercial and residential HVAC
and heating units. Our technicians have over 30 years experience, and because our business is family-owned, we consistently offer our
customers the most competitive rates when compared to larger air conditioning franchises. Other companies charge signficant labor fees to
cover overhead expenses; we at Dalmatian Air don't. We believe in treating each customer as a family friend, and that includes providing
you with the absolute smallest bottom line. Call today for a free estimate and see how Dalmatian Air can work for you. </p>

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

<p>Whether repairing an old AC or intalling a new unit, Dalmatian Air offers you peace of mind knowing that our company guarantees
all new installations for 10 years. We take care of everything, from electrical wiring to piping, as well as cosmetic details such
as duct design. We always cater to the needs of our customers, and will consider repairing a unit first before replacing it. All repairs
to unit parts are guaranteed up to the lifetime of the manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>Even if you don't choose to install with us, beware of companies who push immediately for installations. Oftentimes a part can be
repaired without replacing the entire unit, and we recommend seeking out a second opinion before purchasing a brand new unit. </p>

<h2 id="main">Maintenance</h2>

<p>All new installations come with annual maintenance contracts to ensure your unit continues to run smoothly. We service all units on a
three month rotation. Emergency maintenance calls, whether contracted or not, are serviced next day if possible (Sundays excluded).
Maintenance includes regular cleaning of the unit, freon check, electrical check, leak inspection, and parts inspection. For any questions,
feel free to contact us seven days a week using the contact information listed above. </p>
